Notes:
- Will need to get/store timezone of user (use https://bitbucket.org/pellepim/jstimezonedetect, use it with time.Location.LoadLocation)
- To get digests for non-user owned organizations, will need to list the organizations and their repositories
- What about getting other repositories the user has access to?

Later
- Option to only do this for public repos (repo vs. public_repo scopes)
