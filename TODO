Notes:
- Option to disable HTTP request cache (or at least expire user/organization queries)
- Will need to get/store timezone of user (use https://bitbucket.org/pellepim/jstimezonedetect, use it with time.Location.LoadLocation)
- To get digests for non-user owned organizations, will need to list the organizations and their repositories
- Handle pagination for repository list
- Handle pagination for commit list
- To make a raw HTTP request with the github package:
  httpReq, _ := githubClient.NewRequest("GET", "user/teams", nil)
	var jsonResp interface{}
	githubClient.Do(httpReq, &jsonResp)
	log.Printf("response'%s'", jsonResp)

Later
- Option to only do this for public repos (repo vs. public_repo scopes)
