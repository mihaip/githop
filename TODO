Notes:
- Don't use the events API, since only 300 events are supported
- Commits API supports timestamp ranges: https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/commits/
- Will need to get/store timezone of user (use https://bitbucket.org/pellepim/jstimezonedetect, use it with time.Location.LoadLocation)

Later
- Option to only do this for public repos (repo vs. public_repo scopes)
