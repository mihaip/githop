- Handle pagination for organization repository list

- Digests for activity every year going back to the oldest repository
- List all repostories that were included in the the search in a footer of the template
- Option to disable HTTP request cache (or at least expire user/organization queries)
- Weekly vs. daily option
- Render markdown in commit messages (using https://github.com/russross/blackfriday)

Notes:
- Mention https://help.github.com/articles/why-are-my-commits-linked-to-the-wrong-user#attach-the-email-to-your-github-account if people ask why their commits are not showing up (add option for aliases when searching for past activity?)
- Will need to get/store timezone of user (use https://bitbucket.org/pellepim/jstimezonedetect, use it with time.Location.LoadLocation)
- To make a raw HTTP request with the github package:
  httpReq, _ := githubClient.NewRequest("GET", "user/teams", nil)
	var jsonResp interface{}
	githubClient.Do(httpReq, &jsonResp)
	log.Printf("response'%s'", jsonResp)

Later
- Option to only do this for public repos (repo vs. public_repo scopes)
